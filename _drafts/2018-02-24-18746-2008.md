project 1:
* set up disk
    - 'lsblk' to see partitions on disk
    - 'modprobe raw' if needed
    - 'sudo raw /dev/raw/raw1 /dev/sdXX'
* about 'raw':bypass block device buffer cache and needs address alignment
Once bound to a block device, a raw device can be opened, read and written, just like the block device it is bound to. 
However, the raw device does not behave exactly like the block device. 
In particular, access to the raw device bypasses the kernel's block buffer cache entirely: all I/O is done directly to and from the address space of the process performing the I/O. 
If the underlying block device driver can support DMA, then no data copying at all is required to complete the I/O.

Because raw I/O involves direct hardware access to a process's memory, a few extra restrictions must be observed. 
All I/Os must be correctly aligned in memory and on disk: they must start at a sector offset on disk, they must be an exact number of sectors long, and the data buffer in virtual memory must also be aligned to a multiple of the sector size. 
The sector size is 512 bytes for most devices.

* I don't understand the STM & MTM. I'll pick this project up later.
