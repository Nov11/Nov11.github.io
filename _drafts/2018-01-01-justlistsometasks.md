I can hardly learn any new things in interviews any more.
let me just put them here. Just as a dairy.

guess it'll be hard to finish reading all the books I bought.

goodbye November. This month is all about disappointment & frustration.

things doesn't change much after. stuck in a heap dump file for a while, sigh. 

I have achieved so little goals that listed above. it sucks. 

here comes the fresh new years wishes. hope I'll finish all tasks above before the end of this year. (funny face

nothing new accomplished until now. (3/16)
