* more courser courses
* cs186 -2013 (done on 2-23 passed all tests https://github.com/Nov11/cs186-2013)
* 15-462
* 15-440
* gain more experience in rdbms development
* http server (GET/POST/CGI)
* REDIS unqlite?
* TCP RPC framework
* linux timer
* PUB/SUB system
* mysql sharding middle ware
* memory pool
* DHT implementation

get a decent job and no more horrible job interviews.
I can hardly learn any new things in interviews any more.
let me just put them here. Just as a dairy.
 
 but when it comes to what's going on, the fact is I don't want do anything.
