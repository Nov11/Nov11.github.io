### 19 Parallel Hash Join Algorithms 
#### Background
* Perform a join between two relations on multiple threads simultaneously to speed up up operation.
* This is about hash join.
* Nest-loop jion is suitable for OLTP.
* Nest-loop join on index with a small number of target tuples is similar to hash join.

#### Parallel Hash Join
* hash join phase (say R jion S)
    1. partition (optional) (divide R, S into sets using a hash on join key)
    2. build (scan R and create a hash table)
    3. probe (for each tuple of S, probe by join key in R's hash table)
* non blocking partition
    * incremental partitioning 
    * scan once and generate output on the fly
    * approach 1. (shared partition)multiple threads update the same global set of partitions
    * approach 2. (private partition) each thread has its own partition and need to merge 
* blocking partitioning(radix)
    1. scan R and get a histogram of number of tuples per hash key for the radix at some offset
    2. 'Use this histogram to determine output offsets by computing the prefix sum.'
    3. 'Scan R again and partition them according to the hash key.' 
* build phase
    * hash function
        * speed vs collision rate
        * murmur hash
        * google city hash
        * google farm hash
        * clhash
    * hash scheme
        * handle collision
        * chained hashing
        * liner hashing
        * robin hood hashing
        * cukoo hashing
* probing phase
    * hash tuple's join key of S and probe into hash table built from R
    * bloom filter on keys of R can speed up this probing (if matching selectivity is low, otherwise probing is needed anyway and looking up in bloom filter is a waste)

#### Hash Functions
mentioned in build phase
#### Hashing Schemes
mentioned in build phase
#### Evaluation
* no partitioning proforms a little bit slow than radix hashing
* non-blocking partitioning is slow in uniform/skew data inputs than no partioning/ radix partitioning method
* liner hasing is good in most curcumstance
