### 20 Parallel Sort-Merge Join Algorithms

#### SIMD background
* single instruction multiple data = SIMD
* MMX, 3DNow!, SSE, SSE2, SSE3, AVX (since 1990s)
* this saves instructions compared to SISD approach
* speed things up when algorithm can be vectorized
* implementation is a manual process (colmunbia db may be a good example)
* SIMD has restrictions on data alignment
* gathering into/ scattering from registers can be tricky
#### Paralelel sort-merge join
##### sort-merge join
* phase 1: sort tuples of R & S based on the join key
* phase 2: scan the tuples & outer relation R only needs to be scanned once
##### parallel sort-merge join goals
* speed up the sorting part
* utilize as many CPU cores as possible
* be mindful of NUMA boundaries
* use SIMD instructions where applicable
##### procedure (R join S)
* phase 1 : patitioning(optional)
    1. implicit partitioning
        * data was partitioned on the join key when it was loaded into the database
        * no extra pass over the data is needed
    2. explicit partitioning
        * divide only the outer relation and redistribute among the different CPU cores
        * radix sort could be used but actually no in memory database does this        
* phase 2 : sort
    * process can be described in 3 levels: register/cache size/beyond cache size
    * registers can be sorted using special instructions/ sorting networks
    * data that fits in cache size can be sorted by bitonic merge network(more like specific hardware)
    * multiway merging for large data set
    * usually one sorting process combines these three levels of sorting
* phase 3 : merge
    1. multi-way sort-merge(sort locally, redistribute, sort locally)
        * each core does level1&2 sorting locally
        * do level 3 sorting across multiple cores(redistribute & sorting locally, or say sort one chunk a time)
        * do this both for inner/outer table
    2. multi-pass sort-merge(sort locally, merge globally)
        * not redistributing tuples but using multi-pass naive merge on sorted runs(or say get one result tuple one time)
        * others parts is just like multi-way sort-merge 
    3. massively parallel sort-merge(outer:redistribute&sort, inner:sort, cross partition merge outer & inner table)
        * outer table are range-partitioned and redistributed to cores
        * each core do sorting in parallel on their partition
        * inner table are not redistributed like outer table
        * each core sorts its local data
        * merge phase is between entire sorted run of outer table and a segment of inner table
#### evaluation 
   * SIMD sort is 2.5-3x faster than C++ STL sort(quick sort)
   * M-way sort-merge join uses least cycles per output tuple & has the highest through put
   * MPSM performs worst
