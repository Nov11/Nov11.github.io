### 21 Vectorized Query Execution Part I

#### vectorization
the process of converting an algorithm's scalar implementation that processes a single pair of operands
at a time , to a vector implementation that process one operation on multiple pairs of operands at once.
this is about parallelism of a single core.
#### some concepts
* multi-core cpu with superscalar and out-of-order execution and high power consumption, i.e. Xeon
* many integrate cores (mic) use a large number of low-power cores with low power consumption i.e. Xeon Phi
* SIMD : a class of instructions that allow cpu to perform the same operation on multiple data points simultaneously
    * intel:MMX, SSE, SSE2, SSE3, SSE4, AVX, AVX2, AVX512
    * powerpc:altivec
    * arm:neon
#### streaming simd extension(SSE)
* instruction category
    * data movement(move in/out)
    * arithmetic operation
    * logical instruction
    * comparision instruction
    * shuffle instruction(move between simd regs)
    * miscellaneous
        * transform data between x86 and simd regs
        * cache control:move data from simd reg to memory, bypassing cpu cache
#### what about GPU ?
* moving data back and forth between DRAM and GPU over PCI-E is slow
* major cermercial database systems don't support this
* co-processer that cache-coherent with cpu may change current trend
#### how to achieve vectorization?
* automatic vectorization
    * compiler identifies possible rewrite of loops into vectorized operations
    * this only works for simple loops
* compiler hints
    * provide compiler with additional information to let it know that the code is safe to be vectorized.
    * approach#1 explicit info about memory locations
        * use 'restrict' key work in C++ to tell the compiler that the arrays(say char* restrict a1, char* restrict a2) 
        have distinct locations in memory 
    * approach#2 tell compiler to ignore vector dependencies
        * use '#pragma ivdep' before the for loop
    * these two approaches are generally supported by major compilers
* explicit vectorization    
    * use cpu instructions explicitly
#### vectorization direction
* approach#1:horizontal
    * perform operation on elements of a single vector
    * '1|2|3|4' =>add=>10
* approach#2:vertical
    * perform operation on elements of each vector
    * '1|2|3|4' add '5|6|7|8' => '6|8|10|12'  
* selective load/store/gather/scatter can be building blocks for algorithms
