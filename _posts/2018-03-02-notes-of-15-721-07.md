07 Index Locking & Latching

## Motivation
```
Database Indexes
A data structure that improves the speed of data retrieval operations on a table at the cost of additional writes
and storage space. Indexes are used to quickly locate data without having to search every row in a table every
time a table is accessed. Indexes require different locking because the physical structure can change as long
as the logical contents are consistent.
Order Preserving Indexes
• A tree structure that maintains keys in some sorted order.
• Supports all possible predicates with O(log(n)) searches.
Hashing Indexes
• An associative array that maps a hash of the key to a particular record.
• Only support equality predicates with O(1) searches.
B-tree vs B+Tree
• The original B-Tree from 1972 stored values in all nodes in the tree [2].
• B-Tree was more memory efficient since each key only appears once in the tree.
• B+Tree only stores values in leaf nodes, and inner nodes only guide the search process.
• In practice, people use B+Trees over B-Trees because its easier to manage concurrent index access
  because values are only in the leaf nodes.
```
## LOCKS VS. LATCHES 
### Locks 
→ Protects the index’s logical contents from other txns.   
→ Held for txn duration.   
→ Need to be able to rollback changes.   
### Latches   
→ Protects the critical sections of the index’s internal data structure from other threads.   
→ Held for operation duration.   
→ Do not need to be able to rollback changes.  
 
## LOCK-FREE INDEXES 
- Possibility #1: No Locks (relate to lock manager)  
    → Txns don’t acquire locks to access/modify database.   
    → Still have to use latches to install updates.   
- Possibility #2: No Latches (relate to compare-and-swap, lock free programming)  
    → Swap pointers using atomic updates to install changes.   
    → Still have to use locks to validate txns.   
 
This section focuses on order-preserving index log(n) access that supports all predicates.
 
## LATCH IMPLEMENTATION 
### Typical latches
1. Mutes std::mutex
2. Spinlock std::atmoic
3. Queuebased spinlock (Mellor-Crummey and Scott lock)
4. readwritelock
 
## LATCH CRABBING 
Acquire and release latches on B+Tree nodes when traversing the data structure. A thread can release latch on a parent node if its child node considered safe.   
→ Any node that won’t split or merge when updated.   
→ Not full (on insertion)   
→ More than half-full (on deletion)  
Search: Start at root and go down; repeatedly,   
→ Acquire read (R) latch on child   
→ Then unlock the parent node.   
Insert/Delete: Start at root and go down, obtaining write (W) latches as needed. Once child is locked, check if it is safe:   
→ If child is safe, release all locks on ancestors.   
 
```
Better Latch Crabbing
The problem with the previous latch crabbing approach is that it requires each thread to lock the root as the
first step each time. This is a major bottleneck.
A better approach is to optimistically assume that the leaf is safe [1].
• Take R latches as you traverse the tree to reach leaf and verify.
• If leaf is not safe, then fallback to previous algorithm.
```
## INDEX LOCKS

```
Crabbing does not protect from phantoms because we are releasing locks as soon as insert/delete operation
ends. There needs to be a way to protect the index’s logical contents from other transactions to avoid
phantoms.
Difference with index latches:
• Locks are held for the entire duration of a transaction.
• Only acquired at the leaf nodes.
• Not physically stored in index data structure.

INDEX LOCKING SCHEMES 


1. Predicate Locks  
    Proposed locking scheme from System R.
    - → Shared lock on the predicate in a WHERE clause of a SELECT query. 
    - → Exclusive lock on the predicate in a WHERE clause of any UPDATE, INSERT, or DELETE query.
    - Never implemented in any system
 
2. Key-Value Locks  
    Locks that cover a single key value. Need “virtual keys” for non-existent values.
    
3. Gap Locks   
Each txn acquires a key-value lock on the single key that it wants to access. Then get a gap lock on the next key gap.

4. Key-Range Locks 
A txn takes locks on ranges in the key space. 

    → Each range is from one key that appears in the relation, to the next that appears. 

    → Define lock modes so conflict table will capture commutativity of the operations available. 
    
5. Hierarchical Locking  
Allow for a txn to hold wider key-range locks with different locking modes. 

    → Reduces the number of visits to lock manager.
 

    Hierarchical locking essentially provides predicate locking without complications.   
        → Index locking occurs only in the leaf nodes.   
        → Latching is to ensure consistent data structure.
